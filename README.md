Whoa, just saw Sikandar and my head's all over—like a blender of thoughts on high speed. The popcorn pieces are everywhere, snagging on the theater seat. Back's killing me, like I'd been folded into a suitcase for the last couple hours. The  , tho—it's like getting three drinks into you and suddenly having this technicolor epiphany about... something. 

Random bits... there’s that scene, right when Sikandar's staring at the horizon, and all I could think was how it felt like waiting for an avocado to ripen. The suspense was unbearable. Everyone's leaning forward, like it mattered so much. The soundtrack bounces in your veins, and I swear I could taste the electric guitar solo, sharp like salt on the rim of a margarita.

The sound system was blasting. Sometimes felt like it turned my spine into a xylophone, rumbling notes years of tending bars never taught me. Akash, or was it Arjun, had such a moment—he’s running through the rain, so cliché but it's beautiful, you know? Like when a whiskey bottle and an ice cube first meet, mingling in that chill dance, predictable yet mesmerizing.

> What was that dialogue? Something about destiny being a drunk man's only compass. It hit me like when you accidentally pour gin in a glass, thinking it was tonic water—the burn but then the clarity. Got me contemplating life there in the sticky-foamed darkness.

Someone had asked if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in theaters. Trust me, you want the full sonic boom, even if it means brushing popcorn off your lap like a lost puppy every other minute.

The villain, calling him anything less than Shakespeare's love child with a trickster god would be unjust. Greasy, charming, like how olives are all slippery but you keep going back for more. 

At some point, a lady whispered in my ear—a jump-scene maybe got her—to explain the plot twist, but heck if I knew what was happening. The plot spun faster than a cocktail shaker during happy hour, and I was just trying to keep up without spilling.

And here, remember when...
```
function nonSenseCode() {
    let dream = real;
    if (  ===  amazing) {
        reality = dream + popcorn;
        console.log(The End + popcornCrumbs);
    }
}
```
